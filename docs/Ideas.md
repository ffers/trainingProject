# Suggestions

1. I suggest use uv as project management tool.
    - pyproject.toml is more convenient for project management than just requirements.txt
2. I suggest use pre-commit for code quality checks.
    - commit-msg validation is required for auto semantic versioning
3. I suggest use github actions for CI/CD
    - I suggest use github actions for automatic semantic versioning
    - I suggest use github actions for quality checks and advanced testing (optional, because we have pre-commit checks which is enough for basic checks)
